        It is the ninth year of summer. Seven-year-old Bran Stark is traveling
        with a party of twenty men, including his father, Lord Eddard Stark, to
        see the king's justice done. This is the first time that he is allowed
        to join. Bran's older brother, Robb, thinks the man to be executed must
        be a wildling sworn to Mance Rayder, the King-Beyond-the-Wall, which
        makes Bran think of the tales Old Nan has told him about wildlings. The
        offender turns out to be an old man dressed in the ragged blacks of the
        Night's Watch who has lost his ears and a finger to frostbite. Lord
        Eddard questions the man briefly. Then two guardsmen drag the man to the
        stump of a tree and Theon Greyjoy, Eddard's ward, brings Eddard his
        Valyrian steel sword, Ice. Eddard sentences him to death for desertion
        from the Night's Watch and raises the blade. Jon Snow, Bran's bastard
        brother, reminds Bran not look away and so Bran watches as his father
        strikes off the man's head with a single stroke. The head lands near
        Theon, who laughs and kicks it away. Jon calls Theon an ass under his
        breath and compliments Bran on his poise during the execution. On the
        way back to Winterfell, Robb and Jon argue about whether or not the
        deserter died bravely before racing their horses to the bridge, leaving
        Bran and his pony behind. Eddard rides up and asks if Bran knows why he
        executed the man himself. Bran replies that the man was a wildling.
        Eddard corrects that the man was a deserter, then explains that the
        First Men—from whom the Starks descend—believed that the man who passes
        the sentence should perform the execution himself, lest he become too
        comfortable with ordering deaths; the Starks still hold to that
        principle. Jon Snow and Robb Stark find the corpse of a direwolf, by
        Mark Evans © Fantasy Flight Games Jon calls from up ahead for them to
        come see what he and Robb have found. They find Robb holding something
        in his arms next to the corpse of a wolf larger than Bran's pony. Jon
        correctly identifies the corpse as a direwolf. Theon comments that
        direwolves have not been seen south of the Wall for two hundred years.
        Bran then notices that Robb is cradling a small pup, and gives it a
        stroke after Robb reassures him. Then Jon gives him another pup. When
        they inspect the mother's corpse, they find a large piece of shattered
        antler lodged in her throat. The soldiers in the company feel this to be
        a bad omen. Theon offers to kill the pups but Bran protests. Eddard
        initially states killing them would be best but changes his mind when
        Jon points out that there are five pups, one for each of Eddard's
        legitimate children; since the direwolf is the sigil of House Stark,
        they must be meant to have the wolves. Bran immediately realizes, along
        with everyone else, that the comparison only works because Jon is not
        claiming a pup for himself. Robb and Bran both declare that they are
        willing to nurse their pups by hand themselves. Eddard stresses that the
        children must feed and raise the pups themselves, not pass them off to
        the servants, and must treat them well lest they become dangerous. Both
        Robb and Bran state they will not allow the pups to die. As they begin
        to ride away, Jon hears a noise and goes back to discover a sixth pup,
        an albino with red eyes, that had crawled away from its mother. Bran
        finds it curious that it is the only pup that has opened its eyes. Theon
        claims that the albino will die quicker than the others, but Jon
        disagrees, claiming it for himself.
